# Linux ADK
#

# Introduction
---------------
This software aims to turn your GNU/Linux machine into an Android Accessory.
It initializes any Android device connected via USB as detailed on Android website:
http://source.android.com/tech/accessories/aoap/aoa.html
As of today (alpha v0.1), the software can be used as starting point for other applications.
Later on, linux-adk binary will be calling "accessory_main" function from an
external library so both initialization and accessory-specific aspects can be separated.

# How to build linux-adk
-------------------------
As of today (alpha v0.1), Autoconf has not been used yet. Therefore the build is as follow:
$> make

This software requires the use of libusb and libasound.

For cross-compiling, several environment variables must be set manually:
$> export ARCH=arm
$> export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-bcm2708hardfp-linux-gnueabi-
$> export CFLAGS="-I<path_to_libusb_headers> -I<path_to_libasound_headers>"
$> export LDFLAGS="-L<path_to_libusb> -L<path_to_libasound>"
$> make
